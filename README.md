    ===============Feedback from the Project 2==================================

    1. Great looking code! I love that you took the opportunity to create an instructional site for what you learned! 
    2. Make sure to use a CSS folder and an Media folder in your file structure. It will help clean up your repository. 
    3. A few of your css attributes are indented twice. This is again, just a tidiness thing. Example: line 182 and 183.  
    4. Make sure your cascade is child tags indented one to the right of their parent. Example: from index.html line 6.
       <link> should be in the same column as the other children of <head> 
    5. Make sure there's no extra spaces on html attribute values. Example: line 32 of index.html <a href= "https.....>. 
       No space after the =
